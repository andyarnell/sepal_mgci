Mountains can be defined with reference to a variety of parameters, such as climate, elevation, ecology (KÃ¶rner et al., 2011) (Karagulle et al., 2017). This methodology adheres to the UNEP- WCMC mountain definition, relying in turn on the mountain description proposed by Kapos et al. (2000).

The module will calculate the area of every IPCC class into each Kapos range as well as the overall result

. :warning: The module will only display the IPCC classes. The user has to reclassify the values from 1 to 6, otherwise the module will nest those classes into the "other lands" class (6).
