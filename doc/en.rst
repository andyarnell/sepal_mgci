Definition 
^^^^^^^^^^

The Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI) is designed to measure the extent and the changes of green vegetation in mountain areas - i.e. forest, shrubs, trees, pasture land, cropland, etc. – in order to monitor progress towards the mountain target. MGCI is defined as the percentage of green cover over the total surface of the mountain region of a given country and for given reporting year. The aim of the index is to monitor the evolution of the green cover and thus assess the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems.

Mountain descriptor layer 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mountains can be defined with reference to a variety of parameters, such as climate, elevation, ecology (Körner et al., 2011) (Karagulle et al., 2017). This methodology adheres to the UNEP- WCMC mountain definition, relying in turn on the mountain description proposed by Kapos et al. (2000).


Vegetation descriptor layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The vegetation descriptor layer categorizes land cover into green and non-green areas. Green vegetation includes both natural vegetation and vegetation resulting from anthropic activity (e.g. crops, afforestation, etc.). Non-green areas include very sparsely vegetated areas, bare land, water, permanent ice/snow and urban areas. The vegetation description layer can be derived in different ways, but remote sensing based land cover maps are the most convenient data source for this purpose, as they provide the required information on green and non-green areas in a spatially explicit manner and allow for comparison over time through land cover change analysis.

Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^

The module will calculate the area of every IPCC class into each Kapos range as well as the overall result

. :warning: The module will only display the IPCC classes. The user has to reclassify the values from 1 to 6, otherwise the module will nest those classes into the "other lands" class (6).
